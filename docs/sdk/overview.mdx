# Overview

:::warning
IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE THE SDK UNLESS YOU NEED TO USE [BATCH CALLS](/docs/sdk/batch-calls).
:::

:::warning
The SDK section is left in these docs for historical reasons.
All developers relying on the SDK are encouraged to fully rely on the forwarder contracts directly.
To interact with the protocol off-chain, the CURRENT RECOMMENDED way is to use the following contracts:
- [`CFAv1Forwarder.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder): If you are looking to build using Money Streaming, this is the contract you would need to use. More information about how to use it can be found at [Interact Off-Chain Section](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/guides/money-streaming-with-super-tokens/interact-off-chain) as well as the [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder). Contract addresses can be found at the [console](console.superfluid.finance).
- [`GDAv1Forwarder.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder): If you are looking to build using Distribution Pools, this is the contract you would need to use. More information about how to use it can be found at [Interact Off-Chain Section](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/distributions-and-super-tokens/off-chain) as well as the [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder). Contract addresses can be found at the [console](console.superfluid.finance).

## What is the Superfluid SDK?

The Superfluid SDK-Core is a wrapper library around `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts` which allows 
web developers to interact with the Superfluid contracts.
Under the hood, SDK-Core leverages TypeScript, ethers.js and The Graph and GraphQL.
The chapters of this page provide an overview on how to use the SDK core to
interact with the protocol.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: The most notable feature of Superfluid is the ability to stream tokens continuously over time, rather than in discrete transactions.
- **Programmable Cashflows**: It allows the creation of cash flows that are programmable and composable, providing a high degree of flexibility and automation.
- **Versatility**: The SDK is compatible with various EVM-based networks and is designed to be both developer-friendly and highly adaptable to different use cases.

## Capabilities and Use Cases

- **Continuous Payments**: Ideal for subscriptions, salaries, or rent, where payments can be streamed per second rather than monthly.
- **Reward Distributions**: Stream or send rewards to multiple participants in real-time, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution system.
- **Continuous DCA**: Seamlessly Dollar-cost-average (DCA) every second in your favourite asset without the need for complex and costly transactions.

## Getting Started with the SDK

The SDK is designed to be intuitive and accessible for developers:

```javascript
import { Framework } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk-core";
// Framework initialization code
```

* **Framework Initialization**: Begin by creating a Framework instance, which is the entry point to interact with Superfluid features.
* **Token Operations**: Manage Super Tokens, perform upgrades, downgrades, and transfers.
* **Agreement Operations**: Utilize CFA and IDA for streaming and distributing tokens.

## Conclusion

The Superfluid SDK is a potent tool for developers looking to harness the power of real-time finance on the blockchain. By enabling new models of financial transactions, it paves the way for innovative applications and more efficient systems in the DeFi space.
